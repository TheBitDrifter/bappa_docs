## About

They are called Concrete Echos: phantom-like manifestations of raw emotion. To most, they are invisible: the flash of a reckless impulse, an argument that erupts from nowhere, a sudden stroke of bad luck, a tragic accident. But for you, they are real.

You are Box, the sole survivor of an event that left you cursed with the power to see this hidden world. To everyone else, you're a phantom yourself—a kid with a box on his head, dodging threats that aren't there, fighting battles no one else can see.

This is an early prototype of Concrete Echos, a Metroidvania-lite platformer. Your feedback at this stage is crucial for shaping the final game, so please share your thoughts on the core mechanics and the general feel!

## Core Features (In This Prototype)

- An Experiment in Defense: This prototype explores alternatives to the standard parry mechanic. Your defensive toolkit is built around two core ideas:
  - The Swap: A reality-bending teleport that's your primary defensive tool. Use it to switch places with enemies, turning them into living shields, or use it for traversal to access new areas.
  - The Absorb: Consume the essence of defeated Echos to heal. This choice has consequences—in this prototype, absorbing too much will make a key boss hostile, locking you out of a peaceful resolution.
- Acrobatic Combat & Exploration: Master tight, kinetic melee combat and a crucial dodge-dash to survive. Unlock traversal skills like the wall-jump to navigate the haunted cyberpunk metropolis.
